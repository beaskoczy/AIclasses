# Comprehensive Guide to Keeping a Pet Capybara in Poland

## Legal Considerations
Before acquiring a capybara in Poland, it's crucial to be aware of local laws and regulations. As capybaras are classified as exotic animals, you’ll need to:
- **Obtain necessary exotic pet permits**: You will need to apply for an exotic pet permit from the General Directorate for Environmental Protection (GDOŚ) in Poland.
- **Check zoning laws**: Confirm that your property is in a zone where keeping exotic animals is permitted according to local regulations.
- **Verify homeowner's insurance**: Check if your insurance policy includes coverage for exotic pets, as some policies may have exclusions.
- **Find a veterinarian experienced with capybaras**: It's important to select a veterinarian who has experience in caring for exotic pets like capybaras.

## Housing Requirements

### Outdoor Space
Capybaras need ample outdoor space to thrive. In Poland's climate, especially during colder months, it’s essential to consider both the summer and winter conditions when planning their housing:
- **Minimum 18.5 square metres per capybara**: Each capybara should have at least 18.5 square metres of space to roam and graze.
- **Secure fencing at least 1.2 meters high**: The fence should be tall and sturdy enough to prevent the capybara from escaping.
- **Both sunny and shaded areas**: Provide areas of shade and sun so your capybara can regulate its body temperature.
- **A large pool or water feature**: A pool is essential for their well-being, as capybaras are semi-aquatic animals.
- **Gentle slopes and varied terrain**: Gentle slopes and diverse terrain mimic their natural environment, providing them with enrichment.
- **Natural grass and soil for grazing**: They need natural grass and soil to graze on, simulating their native habitat.

### Indoor Space
In Poland, where winters can be harsh, indoor space becomes more critical during colder months:
- **Temperature-controlled environment (18-27°C)**: Your indoor space should maintain a temperature between 18 and 27°C to keep your capybara comfortable year-round.
- **Non-slip flooring**: Install flooring that prevents slipping, as capybaras can be prone to falls.
- **Waterproof materials**: Waterproof materials are necessary as capybaras tend to make things wet due to their aquatic nature.
- **Resting areas with soft bedding**: Provide a soft, comfortable space where your capybara can rest and sleep.
- **Child-proof electrical outlets and cables**: To protect your capybara from accidental injury, secure any exposed electrical outlets or cables.

### Water Requirements
Capybaras are semi-aquatic, and it’s crucial to meet their water needs, especially in a country like Poland, where temperatures can vary:
- **A pool at least 1.2 meters deep and 2.4 meters wide**: Their pool should be spacious enough for them to swim and submerge themselves.
- **Clean, filtered water**: Regularly replace the pool water to maintain cleanliness and ensure good hygiene.
- **Gentle sloping entry/exit points**: A gentle slope into the water makes it easier for your capybara to get in and out.
- **Pool maintenance system**: A reliable filtration and cleaning system is necessary to keep the pool water clean.
- **Daily water quality monitoring**: Regularly check the quality of the pool water to ensure it is safe for your capybara.

## Diet and Nutrition

### Daily Diet
Capybaras in Poland should be fed a diet that reflects their natural needs:
- **80% grass and hay**: Provide fresh grass and high-quality hay as the main part of their diet.
- **Fresh vegetables (20% of diet)**:
  - Leafy greens (spinach, dandelion): These are excellent sources of vitamins and minerals.
  - Squash: A healthy vegetable packed with nutrients.
  - Sweet potatoes: Great for fiber and vitamins.
  - Carrots: A good source of beta-carotene.
- **Limited fruits as treats**: Offer fruits like apples or watermelon sparingly as treats.
- **Fresh, clean water available 24/7**: Capybaras should always have access to fresh water.
- **Vitamin C supplement**: Since they cannot produce their own vitamin C, supplementation is required to avoid deficiency.

### Feeding Schedule
- **Morning and evening hay/grass feedings**: Provide fresh hay and grass twice a day.
- **Midday vegetable portions**: Offer vegetables in the middle of the day for variety.
- **Small treats for training only**: Treats should be used sparingly, primarily for training purposes.
- **Establish regular feeding times**: Set a consistent schedule for feeding to help your capybara adjust.

## Health Care

### Preventative Care
Regular vet visits and health management are essential to keeping your capybara healthy in Poland:
- **Regular vet check-ups (2-4 times yearly)**: Schedule routine check-ups to monitor the overall health of your capybara.
- **Teeth monitoring**: Regularly check their teeth as capybara teeth grow continuously.
- **Nail trimming every 2-3 months**: Capybaras require nail trimming every few months to avoid discomfort.
- **Regular weight monitoring**: Track your capybara's weight to ensure they are maintaining a healthy size.
- **Parasite prevention**: Ensure your capybara receives regular treatments to prevent parasites.
- **Vitamin C supplementation**: Ensure consistent supplementation, as capybaras need vitamin C to stay healthy.

### Common Health Issues
- **Dental problems**: Overgrown teeth are a common issue that can cause discomfort.
- **Skin infections**: These can occur if their living area isn’t kept clean.
- **Heat stress**: Be mindful of Poland’s summer heat and take steps to cool them down.
